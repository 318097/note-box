## Note Box - Chrome Extension
A Chrome extension to store notes for every domain

A Chrome Extension that provides a "notes container" for every domain. Add unlimed notes, along with an option to mark that item as `DONE`. Notes/Todos gets added based on the URL. Revisit the same note list when back to that URL or access all the notes from the Homepage. <br/> No Login/Signup. <br/>All the notes are stored in the browser memory.

**Notes are stored in browser memory**
